# Space_flight
A generic game I made in 4 hours.

The only key you need to play is the spacebar. The goal is to finish each randomly generated level. Your fuel bar is on the top.
If you want to see additional info press F12 on Chrome and Firefox.
Tip: If you fail at level 1 I suggest to reload page to get full fuel to be able to complete level.

Have fun!
